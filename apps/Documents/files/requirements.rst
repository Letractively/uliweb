Requirements
==============

Uliweb has already included everything it need. But it includes all source
files of uliwebproject site, so if you want to test it in your machine, you
should also install some third party modules, for example: docutils and pygments.

Uliweb is developed under Python 2.5, but I think it should be run at Python 2.4.
If you find any problem, please email me.
