Uliweb is a new brand Python Web Framework. Before creating this framework, 
I've learned and used many frameworks, Karrigell, Cherrypy, Django, web2py, 
but more or less they are not fully satisfy me. So I decide to create myself 
web framework, I hope I can merge their advantages into Uliweb, and I'll try 
to make it simple and easy to use.

This project is created and leaded by Limodou <limodou@gmail.com>. And it has 
received many helps from many kind people.
